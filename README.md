# manifold-lin-dim
Code to calculate the linear dimension for manifolds from De &amp; Chaudhuri (2023).
The directory structure of the code is the following:
The codes for generating data from transalation symmetric tuning curves are in the folder Translation symmetric codes for Figs 2,3
Running this code will generate and save data in data/Translation symmetric tuning
The load and plot codes in the folder Translation symmetric codes for Figs 2,3 can then be used to load and plot the data to make plots in Figs 2,3 in the paper
The codes for generating data from multiplicative tuning curves are in the folder Multiplicative tuning codes for Fig 4
Running this code will generate and save data in data/Multiplicative tuning
The load and plot codes in the folder Multiplicative tuning codes for Fig 4 can then be used to load and plot the data to make plots inFigure 4 in the paper
